## Environment Setup

Before **running** or **deploying** with docker the application, ensure that you have the environment files set up in the root directories of both the client and server projects. The `create_env.sh` script will create the necessary environment files for you.

### `create_env.sh` Script

The `create_env.sh` script creates the required `.env` files for both the client and server projects. It generates the following files:

- Server: `server/.env`
- Client (Development): `client/.env.development`
- Client (Production): `client/.env.production`

To run the script, use the following command:

```sh
chmod +x create_env.sh
./create_env.sh
```

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

Before deploying the project using Docker, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Step 1: Build and Run Docker Containers

> [!WARNING]
> Failure to execute this step before running Docker will result in missing environment configurations! So go and execute `create_env.sh` script to avoid problems.

Once the environment files are generated, you can proceed with building and running the Docker containers.

#### Using docker-compose

Run the following command to build and start the containers:

```cmd
docker-compose up --build -d
```

#### Stopping the Containers

To stop the containers, use:
```cmd
docker-compose down
```

#### Docker Compose Configuration

Below is an overview of the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yml
services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./server
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    restart: always

  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./client
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - backend
    restart: always
```

### Notes

- The backend runs on port **3001**.
- The frontend is exposed on port **80**.
