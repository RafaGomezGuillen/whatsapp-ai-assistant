# WhatsApp GPT Bot

Random crap I decided to create instead of living life. This bot integrates GPT functionality with WhatsApp, allowing for various features.

## Features

- **GPT Integration**: Uses Groq to provide GPT functionality and models remotely.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: The bot can generate audio by preprocessing text using GPT, then converts it to speech to send voice messages back to users.
- **Image generation**: The bot can generate images, it uses bing for it.
