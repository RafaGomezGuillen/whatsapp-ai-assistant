## Environment Setup

Before running the application, ensure that you have the environment files set up in the root directories of both the client and server projects. The `create_env.sh` script will create the necessary environment files for you.

### `create_env.sh` Script

The `create_env.sh` script creates the required `.env` files for both the client and server projects. It generates the following files:

- Server: `server/.env`
- Client (Development): `client/.env.development`
- Client (Production): `client/.env.production`

To run the script, use the following command:

```sh
chmod +x create_env.sh
./create_env.sh
```
